For this project, I chose to analyze data from Las Vegas. It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in world and I would like to visit once in my lifetime. Also I would like to know this place well using this project. I hope this map to be improved in future.

I downloaded the data using following steps:

•	Open URL - http://www.openstreetmap.org/ 
•	Search "Las vegas"
•	Click on "Export" button
•	Selected "Metro Extract" - linked to  "https://mapzen.com/metro-extracts/
•	Las Vegas, Nevada ( OSM XML ) download
•	Decompress the file to las-vegas_nevada.osm (169 MB)
